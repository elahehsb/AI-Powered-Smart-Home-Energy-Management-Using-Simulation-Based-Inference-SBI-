# AI-Powered-Smart-Home-Energy-Management-Using-Simulation-Based-Inference-SBI

### Project Overview
The proposed project is an AI-driven Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) that uses simulation-based inference (SBI) to optimize energy consumption in smart homes. The system will predict energy usage patterns, optimize power consumption, and provide recommendations for reducing energy costs while maintaining comfort. This project integrates real-world data, including weather forecasts and user behavior, and uses SBI techniques to simulate energy usage scenarios, accounting for uncertainties and real-world variations.

### Objectives
#### 1. Develop a Smart Home Simulation Model:

Create a model that simulates energy consumption based on various factors like appliance usage, weather conditions, and user behavior patterns.
#### 2. Implement Simulation-Based Inference for Energy Optimization:

Use SBI to infer the most efficient energy usage strategies, even when the model might not perfectly capture all real-world conditions.
#### 3. Design a User-Friendly Dashboard:

Build an interactive interface for homeowners to monitor energy consumption, receive optimization tips, and control devices remotely.
#### 4. Optimize Energy Usage in Real-Time:

Implement real-time energy optimization that adjusts to changes in user behavior, weather, and electricity prices.
#### 5. Deploy and Test the System:

Validate the system with real-world smart home data and deploy it for practical use.

### Tools and Technologies
###### Programming Languages: Python (for AI and modeling), JavaScript/TypeScript (for frontend development)
###### Libraries: Pyro (for SBI), PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, React.js (for UI development), Plotly (for data visualization)
###### Development Environment: Jupyter Notebooks, VSCode, GitHub
###### Database: SQLite for storing energy usage data
###### User Interface: React.js for building the smart home energy dashboard

### Implementation
1. Develop the Smart Home Simulation Model
2. Implement Simulation-Based Inference for Energy Optimization
3. Design a User-Friendly Dashboard
4. Real-Time Energy Optimization
5. Validate and Deploy the System

   #### Deployment Strategy
        Backend: Use Flask to handle data processing, simulations, and optimization logic. Deploy the backend on AWS for scalability.
        Frontend: Deploy the React.js dashboard on Netlify or Vercel for easy access by homeowners.
        Testing: Validate using real smart home data from energy meters and IoT devices to ensure the system's accuracy and efficiency.
